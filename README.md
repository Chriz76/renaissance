# Renaissance

A metrically compatible replacement for Raster Gothic Condensed in Pebble font format.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.io/pebble-dev/renaissance/wiki) for more information.

While this project is still in its earliest stages, here are some thoughts on the font design process:

- Encoding the font source in plain text files is preferable because it allows viewing and editing with small overhead.
- A tool should be written to convert aforementioned text files to font files (described [here](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Firmware-Font-Format))
- I've developed a tool to extract character metrics and codepoints from official firmware font files. It will be posted here when i've tidied up the code a bit ;)
